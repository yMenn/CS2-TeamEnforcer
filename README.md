# CS2-TeamEnforcer Plugin

**TeamEnforcer** is a Counter-Strike 2 plugin designed to manage and balance teams in the Jailbreak gamemode. This plugin provides a queue system for joining the CT team, enforces team balance, and includes features like CT bans and admin controls. This plugin is in it's early stages and you must understand this is only my second plugin therefore it is not perfect and might have several bugs/ inefficiencies. I am always looking for suggestions and feedback to improve the plugin and will update it as I learn more about plugin creation.

## üéØ Features

- **Queue System**: Players must use a queue to join the CT team, preventing direct team switches. Commands available for joining, leaving, and viewing the queue.
- **Team Balance**: Automatically balances teams based on a configurable CT ratio. Includes automatic promotion from the queue and random selection when necessary.
- **CT Ban and Kick System**: Admins can ban players from joining CT for a specified duration or permanently, kick players from CT, view ban information, and unban players.
- **Multi-tier Queue Priority**: 
  - Players removed from CT due to overstaffing get high priority in the queue.
  - Players who were CT for a configurable minimum number of rounds in the previous map get low priority.
- **No CT List**: Players can opt out of being randomly selected for CT.
- **Illegitimate CT Detection**: Automatically demotes players who joined CT through unauthorized means in the case of unforseen conditions where players are able to join to the CT team.
- **Admin Commands**: Various admin commands for managing teams and players.
- **Localization Support**: Supports multiple languages for server messages.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL for storing CT ban information.
